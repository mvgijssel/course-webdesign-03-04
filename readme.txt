Technical
- The href attribute of the anchor tags are based on my local development setup, so probably wonâ€™t work on your system.
- Files created using WebStorm 7.0.3
- Files validated using W3C Markup Validation Service (http://validator.w3.org/)

Choice(s)
- Chose not to make a separate pages for 'yourself', 'studies' and 'hobbies', but to semantically group all the related information about myself on a single page 'about' and included anchors with in-page references to navigate the respective page.
